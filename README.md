# HA-EEND Speaker Diarization

##  Introduction
There are applications where we need to identify who’s speaking when in an audio file. It could be recorded conversations between a doctor and a patient, an important business conversation, and maybe a telephone conversation. These are the exact situations where the speaker diarization system will save the day.  

When the user inputs an audio recording between two speakers, the system will start analysing the input audio recording. During this analysis, the system identifies which speakers are speaking at a given moment and outputs a set of labels that represent the results for each frame. These labels are used to draw the three graphs. 
1. The first graph shows the time periods the first speaker is speaking. 
2. The second one shows the speech periods of the second speaker. 
3. The final graph shows where overlaps occur between the two speakers’ speeches and the silence intervals. 

Moreover, the system facilitates users to play the recording and compare the graph with the audio sound.
